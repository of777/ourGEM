# ourGEM

This code is based on the origin code of Gradient Episodic Memory by Facebook: `https://github.com/facebookresearch/GradientEpisodicMemory/tree/master`

This is a project for our Machine Learning Course homework.

We've made a little bit changes on the origin GEM to improve its efficiency while maintaining mission performance, and get `ourGEM.py`. To replicate the experiments, execute `./run_experiments.sh`.
